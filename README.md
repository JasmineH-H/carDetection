# Vehicle Detection Using OpenCV and Haar Cascade Classifier

## Project Overview

This project implements vehicle detection in video frames using OpenCV's Haar cascade classifiers. It utilizes a pre-trained vehicle cascade classifier to identify vehicles in a traffic video. The goal is to demonstrate a practical approach to detecting moving vehicles in real-time or recorded footage.

## Installation

Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Then install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

## Usage
### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JasmineH-H/carDetection
```
### 2. Run the script to detect vehicles frame-by-frame
```bash
python3 main.py # or python main.py
```
### 3. Press q to exit the video
